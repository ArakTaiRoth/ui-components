# Chips Library
Chips allow users to enter information, filter content, and make selections in a dynamic way. They are different from badges as badges are static and triggered by the system. Chips differentiate from buttons as buttons appear consistently within the design form each user and contain familiar calls to action. Depending on the context where the chip is applied, the design and interaction of the chip may vary.

Use it like this:

```html
<goa-chip content="Chip Text"></goa-chip>
```
