# Circular Progress Library

A circular progress component provides visual feedback to users after they request an action from the system, e.g., submitting a form, calculating a fee, configuring tables. The progress indicator holds a userâ€™s attention by indicating continued progress while the system loads the appropriate content. The most common progress indicators are either circular or linear.

Use it like this:
```html
<goa-circular-progress
  size="small"
  visible>
</goa-circular-progress>

<goa-circular-progress
  size="large"
  visible>
</goa-circular-progress>
```
