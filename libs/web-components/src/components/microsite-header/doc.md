# Microsite Header Library

Use the microsite header to communicate to the user what stage the service is at, and to establish an official connection to Alberta.ca when the service is on a subdomain. You can also use the microsite header to gather feedback throughout your service, and to show an application version number for quick reference by the service team.

Use it like this:
```html
<goa-microsite-header type="alpha"></goa-microsite-header>
```
