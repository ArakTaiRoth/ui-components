## Contributing a bug fix

1. ___Find a bug to fix.___  

    https://gitlab.gov.ab.ca/dio/core/ui-components/-/issues  
      
    Search for a bug, use the label _bug_.  If you can't find the bug you want to fix create a new one, use the template _Bug_.  

2. ___Create a branch for your work.___
  
    Follow the naming convention _bug/ISSUE-ISSUEID_, make sure that it is linked to the issue request.

3. ___Fix the bug!___  

    Before starting take the time to review the [coding guidelines](coding_standards.md).

4. ___Mark the bug as fixed.___  

    The ui-components team will pull the bug into a future sprint and review and integrate the changes.    

5. ___Review the feature.___  

    Once the story has been pulled and implemented, the bug request will be closed.  Bug fixes will be available in the _@latest_ label in the NPM package.  Review the changes and reopen the issue if needed.
